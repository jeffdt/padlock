# Format:
# ----------------
# hitbox
#	[xOffset,yOffset,width,height]{PHV}
#
# ----------------
# Explanation:
# ----------------
# xOffset/yOffset: distance in pixels between the object's position and the upper left corner of the hitbox. negative numbers mean left/up, NOT left/down as you might expect.
# width/height: dimensions of hitbox in pixels.
# {PHV}:-Extra options that can also be left out entirely
#       -H: Hitbox will support being flipped horizontally
#		-V: Hitbox will support being flipped horizontally
#		-P: Hitbox will be marked "passive," almost exclusively used for things that won't be moving. Saves lots of time in collision detection if on.
#
# ----------------
# Example:
# ----------------
# crate
#	[-1,-2,3,4]
# 
#	This would create a hitbox named "crate" that starts at {-1,-2}, which is one pixel to the LEFT and 2 pixels UP from the object's position. The hitbox would be 3 pixels wide and 4 pixels tall.
# --------
# crate
#   [-1,-2,3,4]{HV}
# 
#	This would create the same hitbox as above, except it would also support being mirrored Horizontally and Vertically.
